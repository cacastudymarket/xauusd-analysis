# 🟡 XAU/USD Price Prediction & Trading Signal Analysis

A 14-day data science project exploring the use of machine learning and technical indicators to analyze, predict, and simulate trading strategies for gold (XAU/USD) prices using GLD ETF data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying basic **data analysis** and **machine learning** techniques to the gold market using the XAU/USD pair (proxied by GLD ETF). It simulates daily predictions and evaluates a simple trading strategy based on technical signals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize gold price trends using technical indicators (MA, RSI, MACD)
- Predict daily closing prices using regression models
- Predict price direction (up/down) using classification models
- Evaluate a rule-based trading strategy based on model output
- Optional bonus: Visualize results via Streamlit dashboard (if time permits)
